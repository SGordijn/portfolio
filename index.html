              About
            </h2>
            <h3 class="article-first-title">
              Who am I?
            </h3>
            <p>
              My name is Stephan Gordijn, born in Rotterdam on 9 June 1994.
              Growing up, it was tough for me to find my passion, until a few years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting my education to become a programmer, I noticed that doing Front End quickly became what I truly love to do.
              Of course parts of Back End was fun to do as well, but it was Front End that became my passion.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my education, I have learned how to use programming languages, such as HTML, CSS and PHP.
              Those are not the only things that I have learned. Laravel, which is a framework, has too been used to create a few websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Better yet, it was the use of Laravel, HTML, CSS and PHP combined that caused me to end up with high grades at my examens.
              Looking back, I think my education went as smooth as one could have hoped for, if you were to look past the mistakes the school itself tends to make.
            </p>
            <p>
              And now that my education has come to a close, I am now working to grow myself into becoming a fully experienced Front End developer.
              Perhaps, down the road, I will want to become a Senior developer. I suppose we will see.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-title">My Strengths</h3>
            <p>
              As a programmer, I like to have an eye on detail.
              I find it important that the quality expected from us is delivered to the customer.
              And so, I like to focus entirely on matching the website or application with the design provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I also find important is the ability to work together with fellow colleagues.
              What I like to do is to use the scrum method, so that there's a daily plan set in place as to who does what.
              It allows for projects to be done properly, quickly and it keeps everyone informed as to who has to do what.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the rest: I am kind, professional, honest, problem solving and highly motivated.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-title">My Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
              One of the things I find important is to be transparant and honest about myself and the things I do.
              That includes my weaknesses. Even though there aren't a lot, I do still find it of great importance to share them here.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I am kind, honest and easy to work with, I am not much of a talker. I do communicate a lot, but when it comes to
              simple conversations, I often don't speak a lot. It has nothing to do with fear, but it does have to do with my autism.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's likely that I have difficulties putting sentences together in a swift motion. However, I do still believe that I am
              way more social than the average autist.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the only other downside of mine I can currently think of is that I currently lack a lot of experience on the field of work.
              Of course, that will come on its own down the road, but it's something to keep in mind. Right now, I consider myself a junior.
              Nothing to be ashamed of, of course, it's simply the start of a wonderful journey.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-title">
              What do I like to do?
            </h3>
            <p>
              What I like to do are a number of things. First, I like to actually work.
              After a small education in the retail branch, I noticed that the job market was at a terrible state.
              The result, blindly looking for a job that's impossible to get, was that I got jobless for two to three years.
            </p>
            <p>
              So yes, that does explain a lot as to why I really like to work.
              Now that I have learned from my mistakes, I am working hard to move forward and make the best out of anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from liking to work, I am also a YouTuber and Twitch.tv streamer by the name of Eclipse Projectile.
              Even if I won't become an online celeberty, I do hope to help out as many people as I can.
              Be they people looking for a form of distraction from hardships or those unable to socialize.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if I don't have anything else to do, I simply like to play games, hang out with friends or do sports.
              This is the type of downtime to truly shut down my brain and just do what I want.
              No worries in the world. Just me, my friends and the activities that I simply like doing.
            </p>
            <h3 class="article-title">
              Internship at De Virtualisten B.V.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Towards the end of my education, I was part of De Virtualisten.
              There, they made websites using Wordpress with plug-ins, such as Divi Builder, Essential Grid and Slider Revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now of course it's not the absolute best of tools to use, however I am convinced that using these plug-ins,
              you can make beautiful websites if you know how to use them. Plus, it saves a large portion of your time.
              If you want to see examples of different projects that I have done in this internship, there are projects listed down below.
